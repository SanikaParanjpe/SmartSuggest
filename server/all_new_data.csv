The project's early adopters were hugely successful international players such as Giorgio Chiellini and Mats Hummels, as well as US Women’s National Team megastars Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan. The way the organization tries to tackle this challenge is through technology, such as a newly inked partnership with technology firm Chiliz designed to harness the power of blockchain-the decentralized online information ledger used for cryptocurrency.

His future prospects are looking bleak, with reports that he had a wish list that mentioned three teams, the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets and Cincinnati Bengals. However, the Eagles have not had any conversations with Elliott and have shown no interest in signing the 27-year-old running back. Elliott's camp is leaking out a list of teams that he hopes to play for, rather than franchises that are actually interested in having him play for them. The stark decline of Elliott is not exactly a surprising one, but it’s a sad one considering how in demand he was just four years prior. In addition to his six-year deal worth $90 million, Elliott's production declined to career-lows last season as he ran for 876 yards on 3.8 yards per carry.","","[{""country"":""us"",""state"":""TX"",""city"":""Dallas""}]",false,"8fdfa73a18b9432cbfa3c3e61d8a4879","[]"

If the league does not rescind the tech, he will serve the suspension Monday against the Indiana Pacers. NBA rules dictate that a player will also face a one-match suspension for every two technical fouls after 16 in the season, and technical foul counts restart in the playoffs when the league will levy a one game suspension after seven.

Before he signed with the Bulls in February, Beverley’s last decade in Chicago consisted mostly of a handful of weeks each summer, soaking up as much time with his children and cramming in as many dinners at the Tavern on Rush as possible before catching the next flight to the next destination. The friends and family whom he left for the past decade are eager to share the life — birthdays, game days, holidays — that he missed for decades.","","[{""country"":""us"",""state"":""IL"",""county"":""Cook County"",""city"":""Chicago""},{""country"":""us"",""state"":""IL"",""city"":""Chicago""}]",false,"b2ec1a91e85344dc955d0b550d93871c","[]"

Players began to figure out how to fix the game organically and everyone is forced to listen.

A specialist who spoke with The Post said a simple flare-up of the old issue is the most likely scenario, but any of the three possibilities would end Simmons’ season. Simmons had a microdiscectomy, a surgical procedure to repair the herniated L-4 disk, on May 5, 2022. The microdiscomy may have fixed the disk, but it will still take time for the damage to undo itself. The Nets are unsure whether Simmons will make $80 million next two seasons.","","[{""country"":""us"",""state"":""NY"",""city"":""New York""}]",false,"17e6a48bf4ee4bfb9ea6172b506a089f","[]"

Despite Tyrese Maxey's 37 points, the Sixers (49-25) have hit a snag at the end of this stretch and are now two games behind the idle Boston Celtics for second place in the Eastern Conference. The Suns eventually generated the decisive 11-2 run to open the fourth quarter, which pushed their lead to 100-85 on a Terrence Ross three-pointer less than three minutes into the quarter. The Sixers were without at least one key contributor, with James Harden missing his third consecutive game with Achilles soreness, while new Suns superstar acquisition Kevin Durant (sprained ankle) and standout center Deandre Ayton (hip) also remained out. The game was largely kept afloat by the Sixers' dynamic third-year guard Jalen McDaniels, who scored eight points in less than four minutes to begin the game, on a driving layup and pair of three-pointers.","","[{""country"":""us"",""state"":""AZ"",""county"":""Maricopa County"",""city"":""Phoenix""}]",false,"b90f7c35a31d4574a462dd6d5a1f6c03","[]"

Max Lajoie struck first for the visitors just 35 seconds into the contest, but the Wolves were able to follow up with a goal from Malte Stromwall. Grand Rapids kept it rolling, with Chase Pearson potting his third of the season to tie the game at two, while Charlie Curti and Joel L’Esperance scored an empty-net goal to seal a 6-3 win.
